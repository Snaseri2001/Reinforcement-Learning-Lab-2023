# Reinforcement-Learning-Lab-2023
In this repository, I have placed my programming exercises that I have completed in my RL course.
## Frozen Lake and Policy & Value Iteration
The first problem involves solving the Frozen Lake environment, which is one of the environments of the Gym library. you can read more about this environmnet on this [URL](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/) . To solve this problem we had to write a Wrapper to consider all the movement to aany directions .All the codes are existing in the folders above.
After I programmed the code for Policy and Value Iteration, I test it with some values for its hyperparameters. I have written some of results in the pdf below:

## Taxi - Q-Learning and SARSA
In the second project i solved the Taxi problem using Q-Learning and SARSA algorithm . You can read about this envitonmnet on this [URL](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/taxi/) .In this project we had to write a wrapper in order to provides the diagonal movements. All of the codes are exist above and the results are [here]()
